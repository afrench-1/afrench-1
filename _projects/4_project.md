Building your own custom 3D printer is both a rewarding and challenging experience. In this guide, we’ll walk through the critical steps involved in the process—from designing the frame to calibrating the printer and achieving high-quality prints.

Let’s begin by looking at the structure and components that make this custom build unique.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3dp2.jpg" title="Frame Design" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3dp3.jpg" title="Frame Assembly" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3dp4.jpg" title="Completed Frame" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

## Electronics and Wiring

For this build, we chose a Raspberry Pi controller paired with Marlin firmware. Precision and organization were key, especially when wiring the stepper motors and sensors for accuracy.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/electronics_setup.jpg" title="Electronics Setup" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wiring.jpg" title="Wiring" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

## Hotend and Extruder

We opted for a direct-drive extruder to handle flexible filaments. The all-metal hotend allows printing with high-temperature materials such as ABS and Nylon.

    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/hotend_extruder.jpg" title="Hotend and Extruder" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/extruder_installation.jpg" title="Installing the Extruder" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

## Calibration and First Print

Once assembled, calibration is key. We used bed leveling sensors and printed a variety of calibration patterns to dial in the settings. Finally, the first print was a success!

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bed_leveling.jpg" title="Bed Leveling" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/calibration_print.jpg" title="Calibration Print" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/first_print.jpg" title="First Successful Print" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Left: Bed leveling in progress. Middle: A calibration print. Right: The first successful print!
</div>

# Custom 3D Printer Build

Welcome to the build log of our **Custom 3D Printer**. This project involved creating a 3D printer from scratch with a focus on flexibility, precision, and the ability to handle various filament types. Whether you're looking to build your own 3D printer or just curious about the process, this guide covers the critical stages from frame design to calibration and the first print.

## Project Overview

This custom printer was designed to be:
- **Scalable** for larger build volumes
- **Modular**, allowing future upgrades
- **Precise**, suitable for both flexible and high-temperature filaments

### Key Features:
- **Direct-drive extruder** for flexibility
- **All-metal hotend** for high-temp materials like ABS and Nylon
- **Raspberry Pi** controller with **Marlin firmware**
- **Bed leveling sensor** for automatic calibration
