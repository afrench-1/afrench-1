## Machining a Small Cycloidal Gearbox

This project outlines the process of designing and machining a **small cycloidal gearbox**, known for its high efficiency and compact size. Cycloidal gearboxes are widely used in robotics and precision machinery due to their unique design, which provides significant torque in a small form factor.

## Design Considerations

The design phase began with researching the mechanics of cycloidal gearboxes. The key elements include:

- **Cycloidal Discs**: The heart of the gearbox, where the unique motion occurs.
- **Input and Output Shafts**: To connect the gearbox with the motor and load.
- **Bearings and Housing**: To ensure smooth operation and durability.

Using **CAD software** (e.g., SolidWorks, Fusion 360), I modeled the gearbox parts, paying special attention to tolerances and clearances for smooth operation.

## Machining Process

After finalizing the design, the next step was machining the components. The process included:

1. **Material Selection**: I used **6061** for its excellent machinability and rigidity.
2. **CNC Milling**: The components were machined using my desktop CNC machine. Key operations included:
   - **Face milling** for flat surfaces.
   - **Pocket milling** for the cycloidal discs.

## Assembly

Once all components were machined, I proceeded to assemble the gearbox. The assembly involved:

- **Inserting Bearings**: Ensuring smooth movement of the shafts.
- **Fitting Cycloidal Discs**: Aligning the discs with the input shaft and ensuring proper clearance.
- **Housing Assembly**: Encasing the gearbox components in the housing to protect them.

## Testing and Performance Evaluation

After assembly, I conducted performance tests to evaluate the gearbox's efficiency and functionality. Key metrics included:

- **Torque Output**: Measuring the output torque under various loads.
- **Efficiency**: Assessing the gearbox's efficiency at different speeds.

The gearbox performed exceptionally well, meeting design expectations for both torque and efficiency.
