Building your own custom 3D printer is both a rewarding and challenging experience. In this guide, we’ll walk through the critical steps involved in the process—from designing the frame to calibrating the printer and achieving high-quality prints.

Let’s begin by looking at the structure and components that make this custom build unique.

# Custom 3D Printer Build

Welcome to the build log of our **Custom 3D Printer**. This project involved creating a 3D printer from scratch with a focus on flexibility, precision, and the ability to handle various filament types. Whether you're looking to build your own 3D printer or just curious about the process, this guide covers the critical stages from frame design to calibration and the first print.

## Project Overview

This custom printer was designed to be:
- **Scalable** for larger build volumes
- **Modular**, allowing future upgrades
- **Precise**, suitable for both flexible and high-temperature filaments

### Key Features:
- **Direct-drive extruder** for flexibility
- **All-metal hotend** for high-temp materials like ABS and Nylon
- **Raspberry Pi** controller with **Marlin firmware**
- **Bed leveling sensor** for automatic calibration

## 1. Frame Design and Assembly

The frame is constructed using **aluminum extrusions**, providing a lightweight and rigid structure essential for accurate printing. The modular nature of the frame allows for easy expansion if a larger build area is required in the future.

## 2. Electronics Setup and Wiring

For control, we used a **Raspberry Pi** paired with **Marlin firmware**. This combination offers great flexibility and the ability to run additional peripherals, like bed leveling sensors. Wiring was meticulously organized to ensure signal integrity and clean management of the components.

## 3. Hotend and Extruder Setup

We used a **direct-drive extruder** for better control over flexible filaments and an **all-metal hotend**, enabling printing with high-temperature materials such as ABS and Nylon. This configuration ensures a balance between versatility and reliability.

## 4. Calibration and Test Printing

Calibrating the printer involved adjusting the bed leveling sensor and performing test prints to ensure accurate movement of the axes. Our first test print was a success, marking the completion of the project!

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/bed_leveling.jpg" title="Automatic Bed Leveling in Action" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/calibration_print.jpg" title="Calibration Print" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/first_print.jpg" title="First Successful Print" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
