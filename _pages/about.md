As a dedicated Manufacturing Engineer with a BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) from the Univeristy of Warwick, I specialize in process optimization and innovative manufacturing solutions. With hands-on experience in implementing lean manufacturing principles and advanced technologies, I have successfully contributed to various projects that enhance productivity and quality in production environments. I amworking towards certification in Lean Six Sigma Green Belt and am a member of the IET, continually seeking opportunities for professional growth and skill development in the dynamic field of manufacturing.
