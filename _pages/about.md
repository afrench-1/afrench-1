As a dedicated Manufacturing Engineer with a BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) from the Univeristy of Warwick, I specialise in process optimization and innovative manufacturing solutions within the automotive sector. With hands-on experience from multiple vehicle launches, and implementing lean manufacturing principles, I have successfully contributed to various projects that enhance productivity and quality in production environments. I am working towards certification in Lean Six Sigma Green Belt, and I am a member of the IET, continually seeking opportunities for professional growth and skill development in the dynamic field of manufacturing.
